# Stock Analyzer

This used to be seperate repo but I have moved it here because I can update it using github now.

This python jupyter code allows the user to analyze a stock of their choice with a few added benefits, it also gives a very innaccurate prediction of what the stock price will do according to prievious day closing price.

TALIB & Various other python extensions/packages are required to use the code, however an example of it working is displayed in the view code section.

Going to be added: 

More predictions
Ability to choose independent variable
A graph showcasing the future "predictions" of the stocks price
