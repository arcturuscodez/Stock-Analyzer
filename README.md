# Stock Analyzer

This use to be seperate repo but I have moved it here because I can update it using github now.

This python jupyter code allows the user to analyze a stock of their choice with a few added benefits, it also gives a very innaccurate prediction of what the stock price will do according to prievious day closing price.
